Datasets: All experiments were conducted on standard benchmark datasets, including FAUST, SCAPE, SMAL, DT4D, and TOPKIDS, obtained from their official sources.


Environment Setup: For the required dependencies, please refer to the implementation of "Hybrid Functional Maps for Crease-Aware Non-Isometric Shape Matching" (which utilizes the elastic basis).
